About GEOGLOWS ECMWF Streamflow
===============================
GEOGLOWS ECMWF Streamflow Project: This project provides access to the results of a hydrological model that is run each
day. The model is based on a group of unique weather forecasts, known as an ensemble, from ECMWF. Each unique
precipitation forecast, known as an ensemble member, produces a unique streamflow forecast. There are 52 members of the
ensemble that drives the model each day. The ERA-5 historical precipitation dataset to also used to produce a
retrospective streamflow on each river. `Read more here <https://geoglows.ecmwf.int>`_.
